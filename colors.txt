Ancestro App Color Codes
Source: tailwind.config.cjs

ancestro.primary = #2e0151
ancestro.secondary = #ff4e00
ancestro.neutral = #ffffff

Notes:
- These are the primary brand colors extracted from the project's Tailwind configuration.
- If you'd like them exported in a different format (JSON, CSS variables, SCSS map), tell me which and I'll add it.
